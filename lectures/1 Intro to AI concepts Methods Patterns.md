- I think therefore I am?

# Acting
- humanly
	- turing test: can an ai system communicating via text interface mimc a human well enough to convince someone that it's human 
	- general knowledge, natural language processing, social cues
- rationally
	- integrate information about its environment and formulate a plan of action
	- sensing, reasoning in the presence of uncertain or incomplete information, identifying costs and tradeoffs
# Thinking
- humanly
	- identifying "laws of thought" and human reasoning processes
	- logic, sensing, learning via same mechanisms as humans use
- rationally
	- logic perception drawing conclusions and new facts from known ones

# what is AI? 
- Artificial Intelligence 
	- the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by **humans**
---
# Strong Vs. Weak AI 
- Weak AI
	- Argues that any system demonstrating intelligent behavior is AI regardless of how it achieves its end
	- Argue that the purpose of AI is to solve difficult problems 
		- obtaining a solution we are more concerned with correctness and generalizability of that solution
- Strong AI
	- Holds that a system should be based on the same methods of learning and cognition used by humans
	- the end goal is "true" intelligence, which would require self-awareness (consciousness)

# Agents, Environments, and Perception 
- agent
	- anything that can be viewed as perceiving its **environment** through **sensors** and acting on that environment through **actuators** 
- percept
	- the agents perceptual input at a given instant
- percept sequence 
	- choice of action can depend on percept sequence, but not on anything it has not observed yet 
- agent function 
	- agents behavior is described has an agent function that maps percepts or percept sequence to actions
	- agent function does not base its actions on the environmental state
