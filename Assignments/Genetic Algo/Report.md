- What were the challenges in writing the program? Or did it seem to go smoothly from the beginning? 
	- i like list comprehension and used it a few times. Not a good idea for readability it ended up running fairly slow because of all of the loops i was using and i was calculating fitness over and over again when i shouldn't have to. I should have utilized dictionaries and referenced it so i don't have to recalculate certain values.  
- What do you think of the schedule your program produced? Does it have anything that still looks odd or out of place? 
	- Yes, the time i put into this i could have gotten a much better schedule doing it manually. 
- How would you improve the program, or change the fitness function? 
	- using dictionary to store values instead of recalculating them every time. 
- Anything else you feel like discussing, asking about, bragging about, etc.
	- yeah my fitness function is really bad no where near 20+ 
	- i couldn't get it any higher what helped was messing with mutation sort of. It would go from 6 to 9 then it would plateau again at 6.
